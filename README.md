## General Information
This Data Exploration Project provides offers, in terms of a B2B use case, an application that can be used to predict wine prices. It is based on a Deep Neural Network that predicts prices based on wine descriptions and is made available for online retailers.
This application is intended to make it easier for a wine merchant who sells his goods online to provide adequate prices for the corresponding wines.
The information from the "Description" and the "Price" is used for this purpose.

#### Deep Model
In the deep model, we did the following things:
- data loading 
- data analysis 
- data cleaning 
- data visualization 
- data preparation

Afterwards the wine prices were predicted using the implemented Deep Neural Network. 

## Technologies
The program was written and executed with 
* Jupyter Notebook

#### Requirements
and the requirements that have to be installed on our computer are: 

- os
- pandas
- math
- numpy
- tensorflow 
- Keras
- sklearn 
- matplotlib
- re 
- string 
- collections 
- nltk 
- nltk.download('stopwords')
- missingno
- keras.optimizers
- keras.losses
- keras.layers
  
## How to setup it
### Program Setup
Open the Code via Jupyter Notebook.

## Recommendation
You can improve the DNN by changing the Hyperparameter and the rate of the dropout layer.
